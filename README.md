# Tic-Tac-Toe
X-O game which we would have played with our friends in our childhood.

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a line of three of their own marks, either X or O, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game starts with an empty grid, and players take turns placing their respective marks in any empty cell. The game continues until one player successfully creates a line of three marks, resulting in a win. If all cells are filled without any winning lines, the game ends in a draw. Players have the option to replay and start a new round. Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging game that tests strategic thinking and planning as players try to outmaneuver their opponents to achieve victory.
